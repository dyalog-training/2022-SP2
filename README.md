# Dyalog'22 Workshop SP2 - Deploying Services

This repository contains materials used in conjunction the workshop. In addition to the pre-requisites listed below, workshop participants will need to download the ZIP file included in the latest [release](https://github.com/dyalog-training/2022-SP2/releases).

We hope to have everything in place at the beginning of the working week before by workshop, and will change this message when that is done. Presentation materials (PowerPoint, etc.) will be uploaded after the workshop.

## Pre-requisites

The workshop exercises will require an increasing amount of preparation as the workshop progresses. We expect that attendees will work in groups of 2-3 people. All steps will be demonstrated, but if you want to participate fully in the workshop exercises then you will need the following:

Required:

- Internet access (the venue has WiFi)
- the ability to run listening TCP tasks (and a free port number to listen on)
- One of the following:
  - The ability to download text files from the internet – the files will be downloadable before the end of September, but there could be minor updates after this
  - The ability to copy text files from a USB thumb drive on the day of the workshop
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed (if you are using Microsoft Windows, we recommend Docker Desktop)
- An account at Amazon Web Services (AWS) – go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and select **Get Started for Free** (the AWS Free Tier is sufficient)

### Recommended:

- Jarvis. A download link and instructions on how to configure and test your Jarvis installation will be downloadable from this page before the end of September
- One of the following:
  - The ability to download and install a sample application from GitHub – this will be downloadable before the end of September, but there could be minor updates after this
  - The ability to copy and install a sample application from a USB thumb drive on the day of the workshop

### Optional:

- If you want to publish a solution, you will need a registered domain name for it (we have experimented with [one.com](https://www.one.com/), [godaddy.com](https://godaddy.com/) is one of several alternatives)

### Very optional:

 We will cover this, but are unlikely to include it in the exercises portion of the workshop:

- If you want to set your service up to use a secure connection, then you will need:
  - a server certificate
  - to be able to set the CNAME for your registered domain
